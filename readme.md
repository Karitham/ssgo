# SSGO

Very small static site generator that only generate a single page type for you.

I have no idea how fast it is, and that is none of my concern, but it's probably not bad.

## Usage

Write a mardkwon post in `posts`

All the files starting with `.` will not be generated, so you can use that to make drafts

## Styling

You can theme however you want in the `style.index.css`

## Templates

For now it only support a post template, I'll add something for index too

## Dependencies

That's the markdown parser I am using, I may make a small one myself but this one looks super amazing
