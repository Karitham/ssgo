# SSGO - ⚠️HEAVILY WIP⚠️

Very small static site generator.

It currently support basic folder structures, but the navigation is clearly not optimal

## Usage

Write a markdown post in `posts`

All the files starting with `_` will not be generated, so you can use that to make drafts

## Styling

The theme is gruvbox-like, because I love gruvbox.

You can customize everything in the `assets/css/main.css` to make your own style

## Templates

For now it only support 2 templates and the code is not modular
